# Improve Hospital Performance and Patient Care (SQL Analytics) 🩺 

A real-world analytics project for hospitals & healthcare decision-making.
# Project Overview:
## The goal of this project:
1. Reducing patient readmissions

2. Improving department efficiency

3. Monitoring doctor performance

4. Understanding cost & insurance coverage

5. Identifying high-risk patients

6. Analyzing medication usage

7. Tracking monthly admission trends

All analysis is performed using PostgreSQL, a widely-used database system in Canadian healthcare & tech companies.

# Database Schema (ERD Structure):
Tables:

1. patients (patient details)

2. doctors (specialty & doctor info)

3. admissions (hospital visits)

4. billing (cost, insurance, out-of-pocket)

5. medications (treatments prescribed)

Relationships:

One patient → many admissions

One doctor → many admissions

One admission → one billing record

One patient → many medications
# Dataset:
20 patients

10 doctors

40 admissions

40 billing rows

40 medication rows

Designed to reflect realistic patterns in healthcare.

#   Key SQL Analysis:
1. Average Length of Stay (ALOS):

Helps hospitals reduce bed occupancy & optimize operations.

2. Most Common Diagnoses:

Finds top diseases increasing hospital load.

3. 30-Day Readmission Rate:

Critical KPI in Canadian healthcare systems.

4. Department Workload Analysis:

Supports staff/resource planning.

 5. Doctor Performance Dashboard:

Evaluates doctors based on patient volume & readmissions.

6. High-Risk Patients:

Patients with repeat visits or complications.

7. Financial Cost Analysis:

Insurance vs. out-of-pocket — helps financial planning.

8. Medication Usage:

Most prescribed drugs.

9. Monthly Admission Trend:

Seasonal or pattern analysis.

# 📌 Business Insights Summary
1. Readmission Rate

High-risk patients often return within 30 days → need better follow-up care & medication adherence programs.

2. Department Workload

Cardiology & Neurology show highest admission counts → indicating priority areas for staffing & budget allocation.

3. Cost Insights

Average out-of-pocket cost is significantly lower than total cost → strong insurance coverage in the dataset.

4. Doctor Performance

Some doctors show higher readmission trends → indicates need for quality of care review or more complex cases being handled.

5. Medication Patterns

Metformin, Aspirin & Antibiotics are most prescribed → aligns with chronic illness trends.
