# Performance analysis of MapleCare General Hospital🏥 (SQL)

MapleCare General Hospital is a mid-sized Canadian multi-specialty hospital operating within a publicly funded healthcare system and facing challenges with 30-day readmissions, capacity constraints, and uneven clinical workloads. This project simulates a real-world healthcare analytics initiative where a relational hospital database was designed and SQL-based analysis was used to support quality-of-care monitoring, operational efficiency, physician performance evaluation, and cost visibility—enabling evidence-based decision-making aligned with Canadian healthcare performance benchmarks.
# Project Overview:
## The goal of this project:
1. Reducing patient readmissions

2. Improving department efficiency

3. Monitoring doctor performance

4. Understanding cost & insurance coverage

5. Identifying high-risk patients

6. Analyzing medication usage

7. Tracking monthly admission trends

Helps hospitals reduce bed occupancy & optimize operations.

2. Most Common Diagnoses: [SQL](https://github.com/Stunga16/healthcare-SQL-analytics-project/blob/main/Top%2010%20Most%20Common%20Diagnoses)

Finds top diseases increasing hospital load.

3. 30-Day Readmission Rate:[SQL](https://github.com/Stunga16/healthcare-SQL-analytics-project/blob/main/Monthly%20Admissions%20Count)

Critical KPI in Canadian healthcare systems.

4. Department Workload Analysis:[SQL](https://github.com/Stunga16/healthcare-SQL-analytics-project/blob/main/Which%20Department%20Has%20the%20Highest%20Load%3F)

Supports staff/resource planning.

 5. Doctor Performance Dashboard:[SQL](https://github.com/Stunga16/healthcare-SQL-analytics-project/blob/main/Doctor%20Performance%20Dashboard)

Evaluates doctors based on patient volume & readmissions.

6. High-Risk Patients:[SQL](https://github.com/Stunga16/healthcare-SQL-analytics-project/blob/main/High-Risk%20Patients)

Patients with repeat visits or complications.

7. Financial Cost Analysis:[SQL](https://github.com/Stunga16/healthcare-SQL-analytics-project/blob/main/Average%20Out-of-Pocket%20Cost)

Insurance vs. out-of-pocket — helps financial planning.

8. Medication Usage:[SQL](https://github.com/Stunga16/healthcare-SQL-analytics-project/blob/main/Medication%20Usage%20Analysis)

9. Monthly Admission Trend:[SQL](https://github.com/Stunga16/healthcare-SQL-analytics-project/blob/main/Monthly%20Admissions%20Count)

Seasonal or pattern analysis.
# Business Insights Summary
1. Readmission Rate

High-risk patients often return within 30 days → need better follow-up care & medication adherence programs.

2. Department Workload

Cardiology & Neurology show highest admission counts → indicating priority areas for staffing & budget allocation.

3. Cost Insights

Average out-of-pocket cost is significantly lower than total cost → strong insurance coverage in the dataset.

4. Doctor Performance

Some doctors show higher readmission trends → indicates need for quality of care review or more complex cases being handled.

5. Medication Patterns

Metformin, Aspirin & Antibiotics are most prescribed → aligns with chronic illness trends.
